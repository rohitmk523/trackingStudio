# Basketball Video Analysis Project with AI Shot Detection

## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive basketball video analysis system that processes local video files to track players and ball, detect made/missed shots with 97% accuracy, and generate annotated video output with structured JSON data for AI model analysis like Gemini.

## Source Repositories
- **Base project**: https://github.com/playbox-dev/trackstudio
- **Shot detection**: https://github.com/avishah3/AI-Basketball-Shot-Detection-Tracker

## Project Goals

### Input Requirements
- Process local video files (MP4) showing basketball gameplay
- Handle videos that may be stitched from multiple camera angles
- Work with pre-recorded content instead of live streams

### Desired Outputs
1. **Tracked Video**: Annotated video file with bounding boxes around players and ball
2. **Bird's Eye View Video**: Top-down court visualization with player tracking
3. **Structured JSON**: Event log containing timestamps, player positions, detected basketball events, and shot statistics
4. **Shot Analytics**: Made/missed shot detection with 97% accuracy and timeline tracking

## Core Components Needed

### From TrackStudio Repository
- Object detection models for players and ball identification
- Multi-object tracking algorithms
- Homography transformation for court view normalization
- Basketball action recognition capabilities
- Cross-camera player merging and global ID assignment

### From AI-Basketball-Shot-Detection-Tracker Repository
- AI-powered trajectory analysis using linear regression
- Made/missed shot determination with 97% accuracy
- Sequential shot detection (up/down ball movement)
- Data cleaning algorithms for trajectory accuracy

### Components to Exclude
- Frontend interfaces and dashboards
- Real-time streaming components
- WebSocket implementations
- Web-based visualization tools

## Basketball Events to Track
- Shot attempts (2-point vs 3-point classification)
- **Shot outcomes (made vs missed) with 97% accuracy**
- Ball possession changes
- Player positions and movements
- Assists
- Steals
- Blocks

## Expected Workflow
1. Input dual camera basketball video files
2. Apply homography transformation to normalize court view
3. Detect and track players and ball across frames using YOLO11 + DeepSORT
4. Analyze ball trajectory for shot detection (made/missed)
5. Merge cross-camera tracking for global player IDs
6. Recognize basketball-specific actions and events
7. Output annotated video with tracking visualizations
8. Generate Bird's Eye View video with court overlay
9. Generate structured JSON log with shot statistics and event timeline

## Success Criteria
- Successfully processes dual camera MP4 basketball videos
- Maintains accurate tracking of players and ball across frames with DeepSORT
- Correctly identifies and classifies basketball events
- **Achieves 97% accuracy in shot detection (made vs missed)**
- Outputs clean annotated video file with dual camera views
- Generates Bird's Eye View video with court transformation
- Generates structured JSON data with shot statistics suitable for AI analysis
- Handles cross-camera player merging for global IDs

## Final Use Case
The generated JSON data with comprehensive shot statistics will be fed to a multimodal AI model (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) along with the original video for advanced basketball game analysis, including:
- Detailed shooting performance analytics
- Real-time made/missed shot tracking
- Player performance evaluation with shooting percentages
- Timeline-based game analysis with shot events
- Statistical summaries and play-by-play commentary

### Court Boundary Setup
Videos require manual court boundary points for homography transformation:
```json
{
  "corners": [
    [x1, y1],  // Top-left court corner
    [x2, y2],  // Top-right court corner  
    [x3, y3],  // Bottom-right court corner
    [x4, y4]   // Bottom-left court corner
  ]
}
```

### Basketball Events Detected
- **2-point shot attempts**: Shots inside 3-point line
- **3-point shot attempts**: Shots beyond 3-point line
- **Assists**: Ball possession changes leading to shots
- **Shot outcomes**: Made vs missed shots with 97% accuracy using AI trajectory analysis
- **Shot timeline**: Real-time tracking of all shot events with timestamps
