## üìã API Usage

### 1. Upload Videos
**POST** `/upload`

Upload two basketball videos from different camera angles.

**Parameters:**
- `video1`: First camera angle video file (MP4)
- `video2`: Second camera angle video file (MP4)
- `court_points_1` (optional): JSON string with court boundary points for camera 1
- `court_points_2` (optional): JSON string with court boundary points for camera 2

**Response:**
```json
{
  "job_id": "uuid-string",
  "status": "queued",
  "message": "Videos uploaded successfully. Processing started."
}
```

### 2. Check Processing Status
**GET** `/status/{job_id}`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "job_id": "uuid-string",
  "status": "processing",
  "progress": 45.2,
  "message": "Processed 1350/3000 dual camera frames...",
  "output_video_path": null,
  "output_json_path": null
}
```

Status values: `queued`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`

### 3. Download Results
**GET** `/download/video/{job_id}` - Download annotated video
**GET** `/download/json/{job_id}` - Download analysis JSON

## üé¨ Video Requirements

### Supported Formats
- **Format**: MP4 (recommended)
- **Resolution**: 1080p (1920x1080)
- **Frame Rate**: 30fps
- **Duration**: Any length (both videos should be similar duration)

### Camera Setup
The system is designed for elevated camera angles as shown in the example screenshots:

![Camera Angle 1](Screenshot%202025-08-06%20at%209.20.54%20PM.png)
![Camera Angle 2](Screenshot%202025-08-06%20at%209.20.17%20PM.png)

**Best Practices:**
- Use two cameras positioned at different corners of the court
- Ensure both cameras capture the entire basketball court
- Maintain consistent lighting across both views
- Synchronize video recording start times

## üéØ Court Boundary Setup

For accurate Bird's Eye View transformation, provide court boundary points for each camera:

```json
{
  "corners": [
    [x1, y1],  // Top-left court corner
    [x2, y2],  // Top-right court corner
    [x3, y3],  // Bottom-right court corner
    [x4, y4]   // Bottom-left court corner
  ]
}
```

### How to Find Court Points
1. Open your video in any video player
2. Pause on a clear frame showing the court
3. Note the pixel coordinates of the four court corners
4. Order them: top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left

**Example for 1920x1080 video:**
```json
{
  "corners": [
    [245, 185],   // Top-left court corner
    [1675, 185],  // Top-right court corner
    [1890, 895],  // Bottom-right court corner
    [30, 895]     // Bottom-left court corner
  ]
}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8000)
- `HOST`: Server host (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `UPLOAD_DIR`: Upload directory (default: uploads/)
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Output directory (default: outputs/)

### Processing Settings
Modify these in `video_processor.py`:
- `PLAYER_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`: 0.5 (minimum confidence for player detection)
- `BALL_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`: 0.3 (minimum confidence for ball detection)
- `BEV_RESOLUTION`: (800, 600) (Bird's Eye View output size)

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Batch Processing
```python
import requests
import time

def process_multiple_games(game_videos):
    job_ids = []
    
    for video_pair in game_videos:
        result = upload_videos(video_pair['camera1'], video_pair['camera2'])
        if result:
            job_ids.append(result['job_id'])
    
    # Monitor all jobs
    completed_jobs = []
    while len(completed_jobs) < len(job_ids):
        for job_id in job_ids:
            if job_id not in completed_jobs:
                status = check_status(job_id)
                if status and status['status'] == 'completed':
                    completed_jobs.append(job_id)
                    download_results(job_id)
        
        time.sleep(10)  # Check every 10 seconds
```

### Custom Event Detection
Extend the `VideoProcessor` class to detect custom basketball events:

```python
def _detect_custom_event(self, player_id, x, y, timestamp, frame_number):
    # Your custom detection logic here
    if self._is_dunk_attempt(x, y):
        event = BasketballEvent(
            "dunk_attempt", timestamp, frame_number,
            player_id, (x, y), 0.8
        )
        self.events.append(event)
```

## üéØ Basketball Events Detected

### 2-Point Shots
- Detected when player is inside 3-point line
- Based on court position analysis via homography
- Confidence scoring based on player-ball proximity

### 3-Point Shots  
- Detected when player is beyond 3-point line
- Higher confidence for clear positioning
- Considers court geometry and player stance

### Assists
- Detected on ball possession changes
- Tracks ball movement between players
- Temporal analysis for pass-to-shot sequences

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Could not open video file"**
- Ensure video files are valid MP4 format
- Check file paths are correct
- Verify files aren't corrupted

**2. "Processing failed with homography error"**
- Check court boundary points are valid
- Ensure points form a proper quadrilateral
- Verify coordinate values are within video dimensions

**3. "Low detection confidence"**
- Improve lighting in source videos
- Ensure basketball court is clearly visible
- Consider adjusting confidence thresholds

**4. "Memory issues during processing"**
- Reduce video resolution if possible
- Process shorter video segments
- Monitor system RAM usage

### Performance Optimization

**For faster processing:**
- Use smaller input videos (720p instead of 1080p)
- Reduce frame rate if timing precision isn't critical
- Process shorter video clips for testing

**For better accuracy:**
- Provide accurate court boundary points
- Use high-quality source videos
- Ensure good lighting and contrast
